  <h1>hi, i'm amanda.</h1>
  <p>In a previous life, I was a data-loving policy wonk trying to solve American education one spreadsheet at a time. If that sounds impossible, it's because it was. Frustrated, I began teaching myself SQL, Python, and other tools that empowered me to wrangle my data and get stakeholders the answers they needed. Since then, I've worked as a Senior Data Analyst at Sonder and now serve as Lead Analytics Engineer at Spin, where I build and maintain data models using the modern data stack.</p>
